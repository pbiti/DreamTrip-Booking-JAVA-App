      <h3>Blue Lagoon</h3>
      <p style="font-family: Arial">Just 40 minutes' drive from Reykjavík, this most iconic of geothermal spas is a must-see tourist attraction. Here, you'll find natural bathing in pale blue water in the shadow of a power station. An entire Blue Lagoon industry has grown around this attraction since it first became a hit with locals in 1976. The water from the underground hot springs reaches 37-39 degrees Celsius and is said to be highly beneficial for both health and skin.</p>

      <h3>Geysers</h3>
      <p style="font-family: Arial">An easy 50-minute drive from Reykjavik, Strokkur Geysir (after which all geysers are named) is the most popular fountain geyser in the country and famed throughout the world. This highly active hot spring area lies in the southwest of Iceland beside the Hvítá River and is a favorite stop along what's known as the Golden Circle. Boiling mud pits and around 100 other smaller exploding geysers are waiting to be explored here. Every few minutes, Strokkur shoots water 30 meters into the air.</p>

      <h3>Northern Lights</h3>
      <p style="font-family: Arial">The northern Lights, or Aurora Borealis, are among the most popular tourist attractions in Iceland. Auroras are linked to solar wind, a flow of ions radiating from the sun. These particles become ensnared in the earth's magnetic field and collide with atmospheric molecules, causing bursts of energy, which appear as large circles around the poles. This spectacular natural light show is best admired in remote places and is particularly impressive at times of increased solar activity.</p>

      <h3>Skaftafell Ice Cave</h3>
      <p style="font-family: Arial">In the south of the country, Vatnajökull National Park is a land of glaciers and magnificent ice caves, which attract adventurers from across the globe. The vast national park (one of three in Iceland) is divided into four sections and consists of Vatnajökull glacier and its surroundings. You'll find a number of visitor centers; those in Skaftafell Ice Cave and Höfn are open year-round, while Skriðuklaustur and Jökulsárgljúfur are closed in winter.</p>
